      <p>
        Quantum technologies are expected and believed to bring about a paradigm shift from
        the classical technology era to a new era of technology. However, the shape of new
        technologies and societies is merely obscure; this obscurity highlights the difficulty
        of forecasting the future with scientific certainty. This workshop aims to bring
        together individuals interested in exploring futures shaped and transformed by quantum
        technologies. At the beginning of this workshop, we share the results obtained through
        science fiction (SF) prototyping workshops, where we facilitated attendees’ speculation
        on the future, specifically 2040, with the use of quantum technologies. Our design
        research aims to develop a framework for considering how quantum technologies may
        shape social systems, industries, and everyday life. Those results include future design
        of some necessary fields, such as “Quantum × Mobility” and “Quantum × Food,” which
        also illustrate how design approaches can connect technological innovation with social
        imagination. In the latter part of the workshop, we will hold a group work session,
        facilitated to encourage attendees to conceive disruptive ideas, as part of an SF
        prototyping workshop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through participations and discussions in this workshop, participants will gain insights
        to research quantum technologies with more solid consideration of how the technologies
        they are working on will be used in the future and how they change the lives and
        societies in the future, and the capability to conduct more practical and useful
        research that will be deployed in the world and societies. Index Terms—quantum
        technology, use case, future design, SF prototyping.

      <h1>Workshop Format</h1>
      <p>The workshop is designed as a three-hour session.</p>
      <p>• 0–20 min: Ice-breaking &amp; Brainstorming</p>
      <p>• 20–40 min: SF prototyping workshop outcome examples conducted in workshops hosted by organizers before (Assoc. Prof. Shota Nagayama, Keio University)</p>
      <p>• 40–150 min: SF prototyping Discussion</p>
      <p>• 150–180 min: Presentations &amp; Wrap-up</p>
      <p>The workshop holds some fundamental principles:</p>
      <p>1) <strong>Setting the Question: What Future Do Quantum Experts Want?</strong> We begin by introducing the core question — what kind of future do quantum experts envision for 2040, possibly for 2050, and how might they use quantum technologies to realize it? This section also presents the expertise of organizers in future design and explains the role of design research in visualizing and connecting technological visions, aspirations, and social perspectives.</p>
      <p>2) <strong>Mapping Quantum Applications and Limitations.</strong> Participants will explore the current applications and limitations of quantum technologies across three domains: quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing. This mapping is not intended to focus on technical constraints but rather to acknowledge them as a starting point — encouraging participants to look beyond current boundaries and imagine new possibilities for future technologies, implementation, and use cases.</p>
      <p>3) <strong>From Technology to Society: Introducing Design Research.</strong> In this section, we introduce design research as a method that enables movement back and forth between technological development and social imagination. Participants will learn how non-linear, iterative thinking can connect technical maturity with future societal visions, expanding the scope of innovation beyond laboratories.</p>
      <p>4) <strong>Collaborative Ideation: Exploring Future Use Cases.</strong> This session focuses on hands-on exploration. Participants will collaboratively generate future use cases such as “Quantum × Mobility” and “Quantum × Food, Clothing, and Housing.” Through group discussions and visualization exercises, they will co-create scenarios illustrating how quantum technologies could transform everyday life, industry, and infrastructure.</p>
      <p>5) <strong>Reflection and Collaboration Opportunities.</strong> Participants share insights obtained through the workshop and discuss possible next steps for academic and industrial collaboration. This reflection will also highlight how this workshop’s design approach can bridge technical development and social imagination, accelerating the social implementation and impact of quantum technologies.</p>
      <p>
        Please note that this workshop will be held upon the agreement of each attendee. The ideas developed in this workshop are treated as open public outcomes. The organizers plan to publicly share media works that tell the future vision and use cases developed in the series of workshops they host, including this workshop, to make a public consensus on quantum technology visions.
